# Spikes

This document records the empirical evidence for the foundation-architecture
walking skeleton: the two spikes that gated the rest of the slice (Spike A,
Spike B), the `.golangci.yml` self-applied config, and two CI/tooling
false-positive classes discovered along the way.

## Summary

| Item | Outcome |
|------|---------|
| Spike A (self-referential build) | PASS, first attempt |
| Spike B (Go 1.26 version pin) | PASS, first candidate (`v2.1.0`) |
| `import:` line needed? | No |
| `module:` field needed? | Yes (undocumented in the design draft) |
| `.golangci.yml` key path | Matches design as written, no deviation |
| Self-lint scope gap | Documented — real layering enforcement deferred |
| deadcode false positives | Documented — bounded allowlist in CI + Makefile |

## Spike A: Self-Referential Dogfood Build

**Requirement**: `.custom-gcl.yml` must declare `plugins[0].path: .` so
`golangci-lint custom` builds `custom-gcl` from the working tree without a
module proxy version.

**Setup**:
- `.custom-gcl.yml`:
  ```yaml
  version: v2.1.0
  name: custom-gcl
  destination: ./bin
  plugins:
    - module: github.com/Disble/dlinter-go
      path: .
  ```
- Root `plugin.go` (package `dlinter`) registers via
  `register.Plugin("dlinter", New)`.

**Result**: PASS on the first attempt.

**Command**: `golangci-lint custom`
**Output**: exit code 0, no output, produced `./bin/custom-gcl.exe`. No
circular-module errors.

**Open question resolved — explicit `import:` line**: NOT needed. With
`path: .` set, the plugin entry's `import` defaults to the module root
package (as documented by the plugin-module-linter example). What WAS
required, that the design draft did not call out, is an explicit `module:`
field — `golangci-lint custom` fails fast with `field 'module' is required`
if omitted. We set `module: github.com/Disble/dlinter-go` (this repo's own
module path) alongside `path: .`.

## Spike B: Go 1.26 Version Pin

**Requirement**: the golangci-lint `version:` pinned in `.custom-gcl.yml`
must be empirically confirmed to build and run against this Go 1.26 module
before being locked.

**Candidate**: `v2.1.0` (first candidate tried, from the design's `v2.12.2+`
suggestion range — v2.1.0 was the version actually available/resolved by
the builder toolchain at spike time).

**Result**: PASS on the first candidate. No version bump was required.

**Commands**:
```
golangci-lint custom
./bin/custom-gcl.exe --version
```
**Output**:
```
golangci-lint has version v2.1.0-custom-gcl built with go1.26.1 from ? on <timestamp>
```

**Locked version**: `v2.1.0` (recorded in `.custom-gcl.yml`).

## Version-Sync Constraint

`go.mod` declares `github.com/golangci/plugin-module-register` and
`golang.org/x/tools` as direct dependencies of this repo's plugin code.
`.custom-gcl.yml`'s `version:` pin selects the golangci-lint release whose
own `go.mod` transitively determines a *compatible* (not necessarily
identical) version of `golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis`, since the
`analysis.Analyzer`/`analysis.Pass` types must match between our plugin
code and the custom-gcl builder's compiled `golangci-lint` core.

**Constraint**: whenever the `.custom-gcl.yml` `version:` pin is bumped,
re-verify (via `golangci-lint custom` + `go test ./...`) that
`golang.org/x/tools` and `github.com/golangci/plugin-module-register` in
`go.mod` still produce a plugin that builds and behaves correctly against
the new pinned golangci-lint version. **No automated check enforces this
in this slice** — it is a manual step for whoever bumps the pin.

## `.golangci.yml` Key-Path Confirmation (Task 5)

The design's draft key path `linters.settings.custom.dlinter` (v2 schema)
is **correct as written** for `custom-gcl` v2.1.0 — no deviation. The final
config:

```yaml
version: "2"
linters:
  enable: [dlinter, unused]
  settings:
    custom:
      dlinter:
        type: module
        description: package-role / import-direction contracts for dlinter-go
        settings:
          roles:
            core:       {packages: [internal/rolegraph], mayDependOn: []}
            adapter:    {packages: [pkg/analyzers/],      mayDependOn: [core]}
            entrypoint: {packages: [".", cmd/dlinter],    mayDependOn: [core, adapter]}
```

`golangci-lint run -v` confirms `dlinter` is loaded and listed among the 6
active linters (`level=info msg="Loaded : dlinter"`, `level=info
msg="[lintersdb] Active 6 linters: [dlinter errcheck govet ineffassign
staticcheck unused]"`).

**Real-graph proof**: a temporary `skeletonMarker` function was added to
`internal/rolegraph/rolegraph.go` (a real, non-testdata source file) and
`./bin/custom-gcl.exe run --enable-only dlinter ./...` reported:

```
internal\rolegraph\rolegraph.go:17:6: skeleton: skeletonMarker: walking-skeleton marker function (dlinter)
```

confirming the `dlinter` module linter is invoked against the real package
graph, not only `testdata`. The temporary function was then removed and
`go test ./...` + `./bin/custom-gcl.exe run ./...` (0 issues) reconfirmed
the clean state.

Note: without `--enable-only dlinter`, the default `unused` linter reported
the finding first and `dlinter`'s own diagnostic did not appear in the
default multi-linter run output for that single case — this is normal
golangci-lint behavior (linters run independently and all report, but
`unused` and `dlinter` both flagged the same line so log output should
show both; verify explicitly with `--enable-only <linter>` when isolating
a specific linter's behavior during development).

## Self-Lint Scope Gap (Task 5)

The spec's "Self-lint catches a layering violation" scenario is **not**
satisfied by the `dlinter` module linter in this slice. The `skeleton`
analyzer only flags a function literally named `skeletonMarker` — it has no
real import-direction evaluation logic (`internal/rolegraph` intentionally
ships with no evaluation code yet, per Task 3).

This is a **known, intentional scope gap for this slice**, not an
oversight. Per the design's "Import-Direction Contract" section, the
layering-violation scenario is satisfied instead by the `go list`-based CI
check added in Task 6 (`unit` job), which fails the build if
`internal/rolegraph`'s dependency list includes `pkg/analyzers` or
`cmd/dlinter`. The real `mayDependOn` rule that will let the `dlinter`
module linter itself catch layering violations is deferred to a future
slice — the config schema (`.golangci.yml` roles) is already in place so
that rule can be dropped in without a config migration.

## deadcode False-Positive: Plugin Registration Surface (Task 6/7)

`golang.org/x/tools/cmd/deadcode` traces reachability only from `main`
packages found among the packages passed on its command line. This
module's only `main` package is `cmd/dlinter`, and per the Repo Layout
Contract it deliberately does **not** import the root `dlinter` package
(that would be scaffolding logic, which the spec forbids for this slice).

The root `dlinter` package (`plugin.go`) is actually invoked by
golangci-lint's own `custom-gcl` framework — an external, generated `main`
outside this module — via `init()` registration and the `LinterPlugin`
interface. `deadcode` has no visibility into that external caller, so it
reports the following as dead even though they are real, externally
invoked API:

- `plugin.go`: `init#1` (the `register.Plugin` call), `New`,
  `plugin.BuildAnalyzers`, `plugin.GetLoadMode`
- `pkg/analyzers/maydependon/analyzer.go`: `NewAnalyzer`

**Resolution**: both the CI `deadcode` job and the Makefile's `deadcode`
target filter out exactly these five known lines via an explicit `grep -v`
allowlist, then fail on any remaining output. This was verified two ways:
(1) confirmed the filtered command reports "no dead code found" on a clean
tree, and (2) added a genuinely unused function (`trulyDeadHelper` in
`settings.go`) and confirmed the filtered command still caught and
reported it, proving the allowlist is bounded and does not mask real dead
code. If new plugin-entrypoint-style functions are added in a future
slice, this allowlist must be extended explicitly — it is not a blanket
exception.

### mayDependOn MVP: transitive false positives through NewAnalyzer's closure

Wiring the real `mayDependOn` analyzer (per `sdd/maydependon-mvp`) widened
this false-positive class. `cmd/dlinter/main.go` address-takes only the
shared, unwired `maydependon.Analyzer` var (to keep the constructor
injection pattern in Design D1: `NewAnalyzer(g *rolegraph.Graph)` builds a
*separate* analyzer value whose `Run` closes over an injected Graph, so the
Graph can never leak into the wrong role). Because `NewAnalyzer` itself is
called only from `plugin.go`'s `BuildAnalyzers` — already in the exception
list above — `deadcode`'s reachability analysis cannot trace into
`NewAnalyzer`'s body from any in-module `main`. That makes everything only
reachable through it also read as dead:

- `pkg/analyzers/maydependon/analyzer.go`: `runWithGraph` (the closure body)
  and `relativize` (its helper)
- `internal/rolegraph/rolegraph.go`: `New`, `classify`, `Graph.Resolve`,
  `Graph.Allowed` (called only from `plugin.go`'s `BuildAnalyzers`, which is
  itself already exempted)

This is the same false-positive class as `NewAnalyzer` itself, just one
hop further down the call graph — none of these six symbols are reachable
from `cmd/dlinter`'s real `main`, all six are real, externally-invoked API
via golangci-lint's plugin framework. The allowlist in `ci.yml`,
`scripts/hooks/deadcode-check.sh`, and `Makefile` was extended with two
additional filename-scoped alternatives (`analyzer\.go:.*unreachable func:
(NewAnalyzer|runWithGraph|relativize)` and `rolegraph\.go:.*unreachable
func: (New|classify|Graph\.Resolve|Graph\.Allowed)`), verified the same way
as above: filtered output is empty on a clean tree, and `deadcode`
continues to catch genuinely unused code outside this named set.
